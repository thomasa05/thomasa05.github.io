<h3>Whats There?</h3>
<p>Hawaii is the worlds largest island chain, and its the only U.S. state completely made up of islands. But only 7 of its 132 islands are inhabited: Hawaii (also known as the Big Island), Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. Hawaii is known for its beautiful beaches, some of them with unusual colors. Many beaches are filled with white sand, but other Hawaiian shores are covered with green, red, pink, and even black sand.</p>
<h3> Why I Want to Go</h3>
<p>It is a beautiful archepeligo filled with nice beaches, fun activities (ziplining through the forest, cliff jumping, snorking with fish), and is an overall relaxed vacation spot.
