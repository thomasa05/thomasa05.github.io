<h3>Whats There?</h3>
<p>Greece has the longest coastline in Europe and is the southernmost country in Europe. The mainland has rugged mountains, forests, and lakes, but the country is well known for the thousands of islands dotting the blue Aegean Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the west. </p>
<h3>Why I Want to Go</h3>
<p>I would love to go there to see all the history, the monuements, and the ruins of the towns before. To see modern Athens, the parthanon, and to visit the coastal Mediteranian</p>
