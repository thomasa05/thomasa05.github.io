<h3>Whats There?</h3>
<p>Paris is monumental, both due to its size but also its wealth of architectural heritage! The symbol of the capital city, and doubtless its best-known monument, is the unique Eiffel Tower, the "Iron Lady" that offers visitors an unsurpassed view. Close by is the equally iconic Arc de Triomphe. This historical landmark dazzles onlookers on summer days, when the sun sets through the huge arch. Notre Dame Cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, is another magnificent and unmissable sight, where you can admire sculptures, the nave, towers and even the crypt! </p>
<h3>Why I Want to Go</h3>
<p>Paris is full of culture, food, monuements, and history. I would love to visit to try the foods and especially see the eiffel tower. </p>
